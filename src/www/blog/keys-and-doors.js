## Closed doors

Some times you have find some closed doors.
Exits that if you try to follow they tell you that
they are close.

    key under the carpet.

    Exits: north (closed), west (closed).
    > north
    Ops, that door is closed.
    > █

If you see a key, get it. If you
want to cross a door with that key,
just cross the exit with the key.
